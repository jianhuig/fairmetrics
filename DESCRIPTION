Description: A collection of functions for computing fairness metrics for machine learning and statistical models, including confidence intervals for each metric. The package supports the evaluation of group-level fairness criteron commonly used in fairness research, particularly in healthcare. It is based on the overview of fairness in machine learning written by Gao et al (2024) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09307>.
